 * [BUG 0.0.1.4c] if ECneed > ECsupply & ECtotal = 0 will make the PAW fluctuate in size.

 + Swatted with the big can of KAID bug zapper
 * [D][BUG 0.0.1.5] the paw label is created from the FSHORT node name in the part.cfg (or patch)
 * [D][BUG 0.0.1.4a] fuel cell doesn't switch to the "Fuel Deprived" state if you run out of any of the currently used resources and continues to produce EC
 * [D][BUG 0.0.1.4b] the H2O+water mode causes the part to mis-function (ERROR) - probably has to do with resourceAbbreviations

 * [D][BUG 0.0.1.3b] missing 'prev' fuel button
 * [D][BUG 0.0.1.3c] current/max display just showing ECRateLimit/ECRateLimit instead of ECRateLimit/maxECRateLimit

 * [R][BUG 0.0.1.3e] byproduct (heat) missing from StockFuelCells.cfg or should be in .dll?
