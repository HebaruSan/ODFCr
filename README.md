## Issue Tracker
 + [WIP] Work In Progress
 * [BUG 0.0.1.4a] fuel cell doesn't switch to the "Fuel Deprived" state if you run out of any of the currently used resources and continues to produce EC
 * [BUG 0.0.1.4c] if ECneed > ECsupply & ECtotal = 0 will make the PAW fluctuate in size.
 * [BUG 0.0.1.3e] byproduct (heat) missing from StockFuelCells.cfg or should be in .dll?
 * [BUG 0.0.1.2b] must have some EC to function, if EC == 0 does not charge
