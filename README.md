### Summary Changelog
*See ChangeLog.txt for full details of mod changes*

#### STATUS:
 * ***BETA PRE-Release***

####  v.0.0.1.8 (DEV BUILD)
 * ns renamed to newState
 * nmax renamed to newMax
 * add new recommended mod: HotBeverageReheated
 * add ODFC and AYA_FuelCell patches for HotBeverageReheated
 * add ODFC and AYA_FuelCell patches for UniversalStorage2
 * fixed typo in StockFuelCells.cfg (replaced '-' with '=')
 * [D][BUG 0.0.1.2b] must have some EC to function, if EC == 0 causes ODFC to hang - just had to move two lines of code to execute earlier. Reason this works, why it wasn't working if vessel EC == 0 was the order of execution. Needed to add the generated EC before handling byproducts, and remove fuel which triggered update state. 
 * Release to Beta-Testers
